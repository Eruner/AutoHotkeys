# Auto Clicker

### About
As a name suggests, this script performs mouse clicks in a loop.  
Couple of times I faced an user interface where I literaly had to click through many, many items, as there were no alternatives at all.

### How to use
Run `AutoClicker.ahk`, it will load script in `paused` state.  
To toggle the pause states between `on` and `off`, press Side Mouse Button (the closer one, usually on left side of mouse). Mouse will be clicking at where your cursor is.

### What to modify
To change the hotkey, replace `XButton1` with your prefered hotkey.  
To lower the delay, increase `Sleep 10` to `Sleep X` where `X` is desired waiting time in miliseconds.  

### Extra
I have included `Arrow.ico` in case you would like to use `Ahk2Exe` compiler to make a nice .exe file
